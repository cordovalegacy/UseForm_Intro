1. npm install yup react-hook-form

2. What is Yup?:
Yup is a JavaScript library that provides a way to create schema validation for JavaScript objects.
In the context of React, Yup is often used to create form validations, where the user input needs 
to be validated before being submitted to the server. Yup provides a fluent API for creating 
schemas that can be used to validate data types, required fields, string lengths, email formats, 
and many other types of constraints.

With Yup, you can create a validation schema that defines the expected shape of the data and the 
constraints that should be applied to each field. Once you have a schema, you can use it to 
validate user input, and if there are errors, Yup will return an error message that can be 
displayed to the user.

Yup is often used in combination with form libraries such as Formik or React Hook Form to create 
complex forms with validation. Overall, Yup can help improve the user experience of your 
application by preventing invalid input from being submitted to the server and providing helpful 
error messages to the user.

3. What is React-Hook-Form (useForm):
useForm is a custom React Hook provided by the react-hook-form library that allows you to manage 
and handle forms in React easily. It is built with performance and accessibility in mind, and is 
highly configurable and extensible.

When you use useForm, it returns an object that contains various properties and methods that you 
can use to manage your form, such as handleSubmit to handle form submission, register to register 
form inputs with the library, watch to watch form input values and many others.

You can also use the useForm hook with various built-in or third-party form validation libraries 
like Yup, Joi, zod, etc., to add validation to your form and ensure that users enter valid data.
